# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.


# Global rule:
*                               @DigiPen-CS314/tas @DigiPen-CS314/instructors


# Other examples:

# documentation folder
# /art/                         @DigiPen-CS314/art-reviewers-team  @art-lead-username

# scripts folders with nested folder override example
# /scripts/                     @DigiPen-CS314/dev-leads-team
# /sripts/another/folder/       @another-dev-lead-username
# /sripts/a/different/folder/   @different-dev-lead-username
